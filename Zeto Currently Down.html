The Zeto machine is experiencing technical difficulties at the moment. Sign ups for the Zeto will be temporarily disabled until we are able to get the machine running once more. The schedule will resume the day the machine is repaired, and the first plates to be run will be the ones scheduled for 7/28/2015. Please do not manually enter plates in the mean time, an email will be sent once the machine is operational. Thank you for your patience.
